<h2>What is boat Buddy?</h2>

<p> How many times have you gone to the marina on a beautiful summer day, and seen a marina full of boats?</p>
<p> Boat buddy was envisioned to solve this problem by connecting people who own boats with people who want to go boating</p>
<br> 
<h2> Meet the creators:</h2><br>
<p> Boat buddy has three co-creators: Andrew Klacza, Matt Anderson and Diana Miller.  </p>
<p> This is our final project for our <a href="http://www.grandcircus.co/"> Grand Circus </a> Java Bootcamp.  </p>
